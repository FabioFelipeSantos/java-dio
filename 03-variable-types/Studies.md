# Basic Types

- `int`:
- `byte`:
- `short`:
- `long`:
- `float`:
- `double`:
- `boolean`:
- `char`:

None of these types is an object, so they represent raw values, and is put directly on the memory stack.

If a specific number begins with 0 (ID, address, passport, etc.) we must use a set of `char` primitives like the class `String`.

For `long` we must end the number with the character `L` and for the `float` we must end the number with the character `F`.
